## Databases are the way of life 🗄️

In our modern world, all our information is stored on _databases_.

Say we open a bank account, then all our money is trusted upon the bank. It saves all our payment transactions, account details in a central database managed by it. We trust the bank to behave properly and to record our transactions properly with no errors.

Even all the details of our social media account, anything we buy like a house, car etc are maintained in a database somewhere.

It is safe to say that in modern life, we live in databases!

## Problem of trust 🤔

If I ask you do you believe in your bank, what would you say? Yes?

I think, we all can somehow say that we believe in the broader system and laws and regulations that our banks won't betray us. Our money is safe with them and we can check all our transactions in our account statements.

But we can't really trust them fully. The major example is the 2008 financial crisis that caused huge and lasting damage to a lot of people’s trust in the banking system.

## The Birth of Blockchain 📃

In 2008, _Satoshi Nakamoto_ published a [white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) where he invented Bitcoin — A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash Sytem.

He therefore invented the idea of "crypto". He presented an idea of a decentralized platform where peer-to-peer electronic transactions can take place without needing the involvement of a trusted third party.

This Bitcoin gave birth to the blockchain technology.

## What is Blockchain? 🔗

Blockchain is a **decentralized ledger** that is used to store transactions or data within a number of participants.

There are _2 key points_ to a blockchain → <br/>

1. **Decentralized**: No single organization or person has the authority over it.

This ledger is **shared** among a number of computer nodes.

## Why is blockchain so popular? 🌟

Blockchain provides many features that make it so popular and people claiming it as the future technology.

2. **Transparency**: Data recored is transparent. Anyone can verify and audit transactions, reducing the potential for fraud.
3. **Decentralized**: No single organization or person owns the blockchain. It is maintained by a number of computer nodes.
